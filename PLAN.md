# Natal Quiz — Progress

Source of truth for *what* and *how*: [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md) (product) and
[docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) (technical design, architecture, milestones M1–M5).
This file only tracks *status* — don't duplicate design detail here, update SPEC.md
instead if the design itself changes.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-03

## Status

| Milestone | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Project setup (this session) | ✅ Done |
| M1 | Ephemeris search module (`src/ephemeris/`) | ⬜ Not started |
| M2 | Solver (`src/solver/`) | ⬜ Not started |
| M3 | Quiz content & scoring (`src/quiz/`) | ⬜ Not started |
| M4 | UI (quiz flow, results screen) | ⬜ Not started |
| M5 | Jupiter/Saturn quiz questions (optional) | ⬜ Not started |

## M0 — Setup (done 2026-07-03)

- Vite + React + TypeScript app scaffolded by hand (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`).
- `astronomy-engine` installed (runtime dependency, will be used starting M1).
- `vite.config.ts` sets `base: "/natal-quiz/"` so the built app resolves correctly
  when served from `brad.tj/natal-quiz` rather than domain root.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` added: builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on push
  to `main`. **Inert for now** — it only runs once this repo exists on GitHub with
  Pages enabled. Confirmed via GitHub's docs that a project-site repo automatically
  inherits the `brad.tj` custom domain as a subpath (no extra DNS/CNAME work needed
  in this repo).
- Local git repo initialized. No GitHub remote yet — deliberately deferred until
  the user is ready to push.
- No linter or test framework yet. SPEC.md's M1 test plan ("generate 500+ synthetic
  targets...") needs a test runner — plan is to add Vitest when M1 starts, not before.

## Next up

M1 (ephemeris search) is next, per SPEC.md's own ordering ("riskiest first" — it's
the part that validates the whole conceit: that generated charts are real and
verifiable). Not started yet.
